in this project i learnt about what search algorithm is and it various algot=rith like linear search, binary search, hash tables.

Task 0:Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
	*Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value)
	*Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
	*size is the number of elements in array
	*And value is the value to search for
	*Your function must return the first index where value is located
	*If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
	*Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value
